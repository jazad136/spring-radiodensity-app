# Spring Boot backend part of Full-Stack Radio Density App
Saddler RadioDensity Backend-based app written in Spring Boot
Saddler version of Radio Density written with a Spring Boot source-code back-end.

This repository contains the back-end code for the Classes app, a webapp that helps travelers find radio stations and statistics about popular radio genres
that are broadcasted from stations lying along routes throughout the state of Michigan. 

On the backend, you will be able to locate a view and an API for stations, pull up genre category descriptions for those stations, 
find what frequency those stations are broadcast at, and what city and state specific radio genres are most-and-least popular across the state of Michigan.
